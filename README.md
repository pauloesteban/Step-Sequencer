# Step-Sequencer
**----------Created around July - June ----------**

## Description
A JUCE step sequencer hobby project.
Essensially, I was trying to keep up my JUCE skills alongside my undergrad internship aswell as applying some new coding concepts I'd read about ( weather sucessful for not :) ).

## Note
This was imported from a private bit-bucket repository whilst developing.

## Features
This project demonstrates:
* Singleton
* Broadcast/Listener (Observer) Pattern
* Some DSP

... among other things.
