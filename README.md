# Step-Sequencer

## Description
A JUCE step sequencer hobby project.
Essensially, I was trying to keep up my JUCE skills alongside my undergrad internship aswell as applying some new coding concepts.

This was imported from a private bit-bucket repository whilst developing.

## Features
This project demonstrates:

* Broadcast/Listener (Observer) Pattern
* Some DSP

... among other things.
